# Part 2: Domain modelling
## - d) 
Add a Domain Model View (or Logical View) to your modelling project, and create a class
diagram with the relevant entities (modelled as classes), relationships and attributes.
## - e)
Add relevant constraints, preferably in OCL (Object Constraint Language). In Enterprise
Architect you can use the "Constraints" tab in the class properties.
## - f)
 Model the lifecycle of objects of a relevant entity with a state machine diagram. In
Enterprise Architect you can create a state machine diagram under the corresponding
class.
