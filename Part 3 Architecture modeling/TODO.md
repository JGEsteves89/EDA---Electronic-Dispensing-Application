# Part 3: Architecture modeling
## - g) 
Add to the UML model a Deployment View, and create therein a deployment diagram
identifying the relevant hardware nodes, communication associations (with their
respective multiplicities), software artifacts deployed on each node (representing the
physical manifestation of software components), and dependencies between artifacts
(see examples in the theoretical classes). Include external systems. Write a small
description (in the "notes" field) for each node and artifact. You may use suggestive
pictures for the nodes.
## - h)
Add to the UML model a Component View (or implementation view) and create therein a
component diagram identifying relevant software components, interfaces and
dependencies. In the 'notes' field, write a small description for each component and
interface. In the component view, create a separate component diagram to relate
artifacts and components with the «manifest» dependency.
## - i)
In the component view, add a class diagram to describe the relevant interfaces, including
their services.
