# Part 1: Use case modelling
## - a) 
Create a modelling project with a Use Case View for the assigned system. Develop a use
case diagram for the selected subsystem, with the system boundary, actors (users and
external systems) and use cases. If appropriate, structure the diagram taking advantage of
the "extends", "include" and generalization relationships.
- i. Write a brief description (one or two paragraphs) of each actor and use case. In
Enterprise Architect, you can use the notes field for that purpose.
- ii. Describe textually the flow of events of a normal scenario and possible alternative
scenarios of a relevant use case. In Enterprise Architect you can use the "Scenario"
tab in the use case properties.
- iii. Describe the pre-conditions and post-conditions of a relevant use case. In
Enterprise Architect you can use the "Constraints" tab in the use case properties.

## - b)
Describe the normal scenario of a relevant use case with a sequence diagram.
## - c)
Describe the flows between use cases with a activity diagram (business process model).
